## Introduction

##### This project is an interactive platform with an interface inspired by Twitter, where users can connect, share their thoughts and ideas through short posts. When browsing other users' posts, you will have the opportunity to like and express your support or appreciation through a simple interaction. Feel free to explore this application. Have a good time! 

## Styles and Visual Behavior

#### 🎨 Navigation Menu Style

##### The navigation menu accompanies the user's screen as he interacts with the page by scrolling down. That is, when the user scrolls down the page, the navigation menu will follow him, remaining fixed at the top of the document.

#### 🎨 User Suggestions Area Style

##### On desktop, we have a block called "Suggestions for you to follow" in the right corner of the screen. In it, there will be a list of suggested users to follow. On mobile, the suggestions area will be positioned below the post creation form and its elements will be aligned horizontally.
